# Learning JavaScript (with Jasmine)

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) describes itself as:

> Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript
> code.

And this is great. And Jasmine is great.

But, in fact, you're limiting Jasmine's usefulness if you use Jasmine *only* as
a 'behavior-driven development framework.'

What if you don't know what behavior-driven development is?

What if you don't have any code that you're looking to write tests for?

That's ok. Maybe even good!

## Use Jasmine to describe your knowledge

**You can use Jasmine to describe what you know about JavaScript.**

You don't need to be a JavaScript master.

You don't even need to *like* JavaScript!

But, if you've found yourself in a situation where you're regularly referring to
[online introductions to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
or always forgetting how you use a [specific library](http://underscorejs.org/),
then here's a way forward.

## A Way Forward

What do you get if you learn to use Jasmine to describe what you know about
JavaScript / the Library / whatever?

Once you become familiar with Jasmine, it's almost as easy as writing up notes
about the topic at hand.

But, *bonus*, these notes execute themselves when viewed in a browser.

And, *bonus*, if you view your notes in different browsers, you're verifying
that things are working *as you expect* cross browser.

And, *bonus*, you've got an easier way to reference or share your notes (check
them in somewhere that's web accessible).

## And then?

The investment is relatively small (1 day? Less? You tell me).

You learn Jasmine, which will likely come in handy if you continue working with
JavaScript.

You learn about a means for taking executable notes. They are easily referenced.
They are easily searched. They can easily be verified cross-browser.

But most importantly, you start getting involved with a paradigm that can be
helpful regardless of the language you're working in. For example-- you can take
the same approach in [Ruby](https://github.com/jedcn/learning-ruby).
